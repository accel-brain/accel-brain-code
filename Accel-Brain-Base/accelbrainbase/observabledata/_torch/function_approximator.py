class FunctionApproximator(ObservableData):
    '''
    The function approximator for the Deep Q-Learning.

    The convolutional neural networks(CNNs) are hierarchical models 
    whose convolutional layers alternate with subsampling layers, 
    reminiscent of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex.
    
    Mainly, this class demonstrates that a CNNs can solve generalisation problems to learn 
    successful control policies from observed data points in complex 
    Reinforcement Learning environments. The network is trained with a variant of 
    the Q-learning algorithm, with stochastic gradient descent to update the weights.

    But there is no need for the function approximator to be a CNNs.
    We probide this interface that implements various models as 
    function approximations, not limited to CNNs.
