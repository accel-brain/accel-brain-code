    The energy-based Adversarial Auto-Encoders(EBAAEs).

    The Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) framework establishes 
    a min-max adversarial game between two neural networks â€“ a generative model, `G`, and a 
    discriminative model, `D`. The discriminator model, `D(x)`, is a neural network that computes 
    the probability that a observed data point x in data space is a sample from the data 
    distribution (positive samples) that we are trying to model, rather than a sample from our 
    generative model (negative samples). 
    
    Concurrently, the generator uses a function `G(z)` that maps samples z from the prior `p(z)` to 
    the data space. `G(z)` is trained to maximally confuse the discriminator into believing that 
    samples it generates come from the data distribution. The generator is trained by leveraging 
    the gradient of `D(x)` w.r.t. x, and using that to modify its parameters.

    The Conditional GANs (or cGANs) is a simple extension of the basic GAN model which allows 
    the model to condition on external information. This makes it possible to engage the learned 
    generative model in different "modes" by providing it with different contextual information (Gauthier, J. 2014).

    This model can be constructed by simply feeding the data, `y`, to condition on to both the generator 
    and discriminator. In an unconditioned generative model, because the maps samples z from the prior 
    `p(z)` are drawn from uniform or normal distribution, there is no control on modes of the data being 
    generated. On the other hand, it is possible to direct the data generation process by conditioning 
    the model on additional information (Mirza, M., & Osindero, S. 2014).

    The Energy-based GAN framework considers the discriminator as an energy function, 
    which assigns low energy values to real data and high to fake data. 
    The generator is a trainable parameterized function that produces 
    samples in regions to which the discriminator assigns low energy. 

    This library also provides the Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs), 
    which is a probabilistic Auto-Encoder that uses GANs to perform variational 
    inference by matching the aggregated posterior of the feature points 
    in hidden layer of the Auto-Encoder with an arbitrary prior 
    distribution(Makhzani, A., et al., 2015). Matching the aggregated posterior 
    to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results 
    in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the Adversarial Auto-Encoder 
    learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution.
