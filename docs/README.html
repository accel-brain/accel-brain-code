<p>The purpose of this repository is to make prototypes as case study in the context of proof of concept(PoC) and research and development(R&amp;D) that I have written in my website: <a class="reference external" href="https://accel-brain.com">Accel Brain</a> (Japanese) and <a class="reference external" href="https://accel-brain.co.jp/">Accel Brain Co., Ltd.</a> (Japanese). The main research topics are Auto-Encoders in relation to the representation learning, the statistical machine learning for energy-based models, adversarial generation networks(GANs), Deep Reinforcement Learning such as Deep Q-Networks, semi-supervised learning, and neural network language model for natural language processing.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-setting-deep-learning-after-the-era-of-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-ai">
<span id="problem-setting-deep-learning-after-the-era-of-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-ai"></span><h2>Problem Setting: Deep Learning after the era of “Democratization of Artificial Intelligence(AI)”.<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-setting-deep-learning-after-the-era-of-democratization-of-artificial-intelligence-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How the Research and Development(R&amp;D) on the subject of machine learning including deep learning, after the era of “Democratization of Artificial Intelligence(AI)”, can become possible? Simply implementing the models and algorithms provided by standard machine learning libraries and applications like AutoML would reinvent the wheel. If you just copy and paste the demo code from the library and use it, your R&amp;D would fall into dogmatically authoritarian development, or so-called the Hype driven development.</p>
<p>If you fall in love with the concept of “Democratization of AI,” you may forget the reality that the R&amp;D is under the influence of not only democracy but also capitalism. The R&amp;D provides economic value when its R&amp;D artifacts are distinguished from the models and algorithms realized by standard machine learning libraries and applications such as AutoML. In general terms, R&amp;D must provide a differentiator to maximize the scarcity of its implementation artifacts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it must be remembered that any R&amp;D builds on the history of the social structure and the semantics of the concepts envisioned by previous studies. Many models and algorithms are variants derived not only from research but also from the relationship with business domains. It is impossible to assume differentiating factors without taking commonality and identity between society and its history.</p>

<span id="problem-solution-poc-of-poc"></span><h3>Problem Solution: PoC of PoC.<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-solution-poc-of-poc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The blind spot of “democratization of AI” occurs when a new concept is created throughout the society, including business. It takes time before a new concept can be broken down into an interface specification from a perspective such as object-oriented analysis, and code that conforms to the interface specification can be implemented. There will always be some difference between the new AI created in this way and the AI already “democratized”.</p>
<p>In a more realistic perspective, casual users who are just waiting for the AI to be “democratized” will always fall behind. On the contrary, those who can create new concepts and new AIs with PoC will always continue to have a leading advantage in the market where AI is the main topic. Hiding behind the “democratic” movement of “AI democratization” is the dry reality of “capitalist” competition.</p>

<span id="lifehack-of-lifehack"></span><h4>Lifehack of Lifehack.<a class="headerlink" href="#lifehack-of-lifehack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The basic theme in my PoC is a Lifehack, which is any technique that reduces the burden of our life and make it easier to control, or more convenient. Considering that many lifehack solutions are technological and obviously product design and development technology are kind of <em>life</em> which can be <em>hacked</em>, lifehack itself also can be purpose of lifehack. Because of this <em>Autologie</em>, a seemingly endless round of my PoC and technological prototypes is rotary driven by <em>Selbstreferenz</em> to repeat <em>lifehack of lifehack</em> cyclically.</p>
<p>In this problem setting and <em>recursive</em> solutions, this repository is functionally differentiated by compositions such as information collection, searching optimal solution, and focus booster. Each function can be considered an integral component of lifehack solutions. These tools make it possible to efficiency the process of contemplation and accelerate our brain, enabling provisions for the developments of other tools in this repository. All code, implemented as in an algorithm of machine learning or data science, reflects the concept of proof of concept(PoC).</p>

<p>As part of prototyping, this repository publishes a special machine learning library, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Accel-Brain-Base">Accel-Brain-Base</a>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">accel-brain-base</span></code> is a basic library of the Deep Learning for rapid development at low cost. This library makes it possible to design and implement deep learning, which must be configured as a complex system or a System of Systems, by combining a plurality of functionally differentiated modules such as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM), Deep Boltzmann Machines(DBMs), a Stacked-Auto-Encoder, an Encoder/Decoder based on Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), and a Convolutional Auto-Encoder(CAE).</p>
<p>From the view points of functionally equivalents and structural expansions, this library also prototypes many variants such as energy-based models and Generative models. Typical examples are Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs). In addition, it provides deep reinforcement learning that applies the neural network described above as a function approximator.</p>
<p>Considering many variable parts, structural unions, and <em>functional equivalents</em> in the deep learning paradigm, which are variants derived not only from research but also from the relationship with business domains, from perspective of <em>commonality/variability analysis</em> in order to practice object-oriented design, this library provides abstract classes that define the skeleton of the deep Learning algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps in concrete variant algorithms such as the <strong>Deep Boltzmann Machines</strong>, <strong>Stacked Auto-Encoder</strong>, <strong>Encoder/Decoder based on LSTM</strong>, and <strong>Convolutional Auto-Encoder</strong> to client subclasses. The abstract classes and the interfaces in this library let subclasses redefine certain steps of the deep Learning algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.</p>
<p>These abstract classes can also provide new original models and algorithms such as <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)</strong>, <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong>, or <strong>Neural network language model</strong> by implementing the variable parts of the fluid elements of objects.</p>

<p>This problem can be re-described as the multi-agent control problem, which involves decomposing the global system state into an image like representation with information encoded in separate channels.

<p>There are many hyperparameters that we have to set before the actual searching and learning process begins. Each parameter should be decided in relation to Reinforcement Learning theory and it cause side effects in training model. This issue can be considered as <strong>Combinatorial optimization problem</strong> which is an optimization problem, where an optimal solution has to be identified from a finite set of solutions. In this problem setting, this library provides an Annealing Model such as <strong>Simulated Annealing</strong> to search optimal combination of hyperparameters.</p>
<p>As exemplified in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/blob/master/Reinforcement-Learning/annealing_hand_written_digits.ipynb">annealing_hand_written_digits.ipynb</a>, there are many functional extensions and functional equivalents of Simulated Annealing. For instance, <strong>Adaptive Simulated Annealing</strong>, also known as the very fast simulated reannealing, is a very efficient version of simulated annealing. And <strong>Quantum Monte Carlo</strong>, which is generally known a stochastic method to solve the Schrödinger equation, is one of the earliest types of solution in order to simulate the <strong>Quantum Annealing</strong> in classical computer.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pygan</span></code> is Python library to implement Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs).</p>
<p>This library makes it possible to design the Generative models based on the Statistical machine learning problems in relation to Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs) to practice algorithm design for semi-supervised learning.</p>
<p>The Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) framework establishes a
min-max adversarial game between two neural networks – a generative model, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span></code>, and a discriminative
model, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D</span></code>. The discriminator model, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D(x)</span></code>, is a neural network that computes the probability that
a observed data point <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> in data space is a sample from the data distribution (positive samples) that we are trying to model, rather than a sample from our generative model (negative samples). Concurrently, the generator uses a function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G(z)</span></code> that maps samples <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">z</span></code> from the prior <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p(z)</span></code> to the data space. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G(z)</span></code> is trained to maximally confuse the discriminator into believing that samples it generates come from the data distribution. The generator is trained by leveraging the gradient of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D(x)</span></code> w.r.t. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code>, and using that to modify its parameters.</p>
<p>This library provides the Adversarial Auto-Encoders(AAEs), which is a probabilistic Auto-Encoder that uses GANs to perform variational inference by matching the aggregated posterior of the feature points in hidden layer of the Auto-Encoder with an arbitrary prior distribution(Makhzani, A., et al., 2015). Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the Adversarial Auto-Encoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution.</p>
